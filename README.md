# Responsive_Blog_Page
Hi!
This is a Web Development Project. 
It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to generate a Responsive Blog Page. 
This project focuses on creating a responsive blog page having Search, Blog, and Contact us sections.
It uses HTML to create the base of the web site and CSS for styling while using Java script for the base programming.
I hope you like it.
